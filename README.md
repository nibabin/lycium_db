# Lycium database project - Databases Fall 2023

Description:

Prof. Miller regularly collects lycium plants from different parts of the world, brings them to Amherst, and samples their DNA. There are over 3000 samples.
Each different sample has a unique Field ID. 
The current database was built 20 years ago. Prof. Miller would like an updated version of the database and the website. 
Updates will include a migration to PostgreSQL, a new user interface, and the option to convert the data to an excel sheet.
