1. A revision (possibly an expansion, a reduction, a refinement, or whatever is needed) of your project that you developed in phase 1, possibly through more requirement analysis performed together with the user.


* ER schema modified and fleshed out (adding entities)
* Add Google Maps support for displaying longitude/latitude coordinates of specimen collection site
* Additional revisions to come following 10/18/23 meeting with Prof. Riondato and Prof. Miller


2. A tentatively final ER schema of your database.
(see er.png)
  







3. An initial translation of the ER schema into a relational schema.


CREATE TABLE Specimen(
        species Char(20) NOT NULL,
        coordinates Char(25) NOT NULL (?)
        field_id Char(15),
        genomic Integer,
        voucher Char(20),
        notes Char(256),
        collection_date Date,
        PRIMARY KEY (field_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (species) REFERENCES Type,
        FOREIGN KEY (coordinates) REFERENCES Location)
        
 


4. A first assignment of roles to your team members for phase 3.
        
                Backend:
                Tania, Ryan


                Frontend:
                Charlie, Claudiu


                PostgreSQL: 
                Charlie, Claudiu, Ryan, Tania


5. A list of open questions about your project, which you plan to answer in phase 3.
* How can we manipulate data to make a project more beneficial? We are considering showing students’ research that has used materials from the database. 
* How can we add more relationships between entities? 
* Can we keep and utilize entities like COS30, or ITS to make a project more interesting?
